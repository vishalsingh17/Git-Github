# Git & GitHub

Git is a modern and widely used **distributed version control** system in the world. It is developed to manage projects with high speed and efficiency. The version control system allows us to monitor and work together with our team members at the same workspace.

### What is Git?

**Git** is an **open-source distributed version control system**. It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency. It is developed to co-ordinate the work among the developers. The version control allows us to track and work together with our team members at the same workspace.

Git is foundation of many services like **GitHub** and **GitLab**, but we can use Git without using any other Git services. Git can be used **privately** and **publicly**.

Git was created by **Linus Torvalds** in **2005** to develop Linux Kernel. It is also used as an important distributed version-control tool for **the DevOps**.

Git is easy to learn, and has fast performance. It is superior to other SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase.

### Features of Git:

- Open source

Git is an open-source tool. It is released under the GPL (General Public License) license.

- Scalable

Git is **scalable**, which means when the number of users increases, the Git can easily handle such situations.

- Distributed

One of Git's great features is that it is **distributed**. Distributed means that instead of switching the project to another machine, we can create a "clone" of the entire repository. Also, instead of just having one central repository that you send changes to, every user has their own repository that contains the entire commit history of the project. We do not need to connect to the remote repository; the change is just stored on our local repository. If necessary, we can push these changes to a remote repository.

- Security

Git is secure. It uses the **SHA1 (Secure Hash Function)** to name and identify objects within its repository. Files and commits are checked and retrieved by its checksum at the time of checkout. It stores its history in such a way that the ID of particular commits depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit. Once it is published, one cannot make changes to its old version.
